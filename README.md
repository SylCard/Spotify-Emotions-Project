# Spotify Capstone Project
This project is used for a capstone project for a data science class that I took at UCLA Extension.

~~As my own music tastes have matured, I started to grow old of the music that Spotify was recommending me. Seriously, Spotify always plays LCD Soundsystem after a playlist ends. I basically hate LCD Soundsystem now. Did I really listen to that much LCD Soundsystem? I couldn't have.~~

UPDATE 04/2020:
LCD Soundsystem still plays sometimes, but I have somewhat reduced the frequency of his discography flooding my eardrums.

Anywho, as part of my mission to discover new music and as part of a larger journey to become digitally polyglottal, I figured I could "grab a few fruit for the same price": explore some data, work on my programming knowledge, discover new music. Since music is such a large part of my daily routine I decided that, for my project, I'd leverage the Spotify API to accomplish all of these tasks.

There is a ton of information online that leverages the Spotify API. The class itself was focused more on analysis over coding tasks, therefore, I decided that it wouldn't
be against any rules to lift some code from other projects.

ANOTHER UPDATE 04/2020:
I reached out to the developer who I forked this repo from. He was very humble. Nice guy. :)
